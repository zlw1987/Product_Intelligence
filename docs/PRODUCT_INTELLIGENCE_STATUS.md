# Product Intelligence — Current Status

## Current state

**PRODUCT-INTEL.PILOT-UX — Semantic qualification APPROVED/FROZEN;
FU3A Production Semantic Runtime Contract APPROVED/FROZEN;
FU3B Semantic Execution Integration APPROVED/FROZEN.**

Semantic qualification is APPROVED AND FROZEN:
- Semantic qualification corpus, prompt v1.1, evaluator mathematics,
  qualification thresholds, expected decisions, and safety gates approved
- Prompt v1.1 FULL SHA256: f50e5584659f953ce73a97ccc8bc1ff487fbeeb37e2e0a72e52210613aeab1ff
- Corpus SHA256: 3c21d6fcd4eefa5cc383792abfd9308bd5c03315834c8ffdffd0f6a2b3619ca1

**Two models passed the formal FULL qualification gates.** They are the
qualified production route:

| Role | Provider | Model |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PRIMARY | `amax` | `nemotron-3-super` |
| FALLBACK | `vllm-262k` | `Qwen3.6-27B-262K` |

Generation settings are fixed at `temperature=0.0`, `max_tokens=32768`.

FU3A — Production Semantic Runtime Contract — **APPROVED / FROZEN**
(corrective history: FU3A2B/C/D/E/F; FU3A2F was the final corrective pass —
ChatGPT's review of the final FU3A2F `runtime.py` and `test_runtime.py`
approved the contract):

FU3B — Semantic execution integration — **APPROVED / FROZEN**
(corrective history: FU3B was the execution-wiring pass; MiniMax M2.7 Thinking
independently reviewed the final FU3B implementation and found no production-code
or safety-contract blocker; ChatGPT performed the final approval/freeze review):
- `product_intelligence/semantic/contract.py` is the single source of truth for
  prompt v1.1, the decision vocabulary, the response schema, and the strict
  parser/validator. The evaluation harness re-exports those same objects;
  production does not depend on `evaluation.semantic.*`.
- `product_intelligence/semantic/transport.py` is the single source of truth
  for the transport implementation (HTTP call, error classification,
  `SemanticModelTransport`/`OpenAISemanticTransport`/`FakeSemanticModelTransport`);
  `evaluation/semantic/transport.py` re-exports it rather than keeping a copy.
- `product_intelligence/semantic/runtime.py` pins the qualified route
  (validation rejects any other provider/model/temperature/max_tokens before a
  transport call — temperature is checked by exact type, `type(x) is float`,
  so `0`/`False` are rejected even though numerically equal to `0.0`), falls
  back on an EXPLICIT allowlist of execution failures, requires exact
  provider-reported model identity, records per-attempt provenance, and never
  converts a programming exception into a fallback.
- The fallback allowlist and error taxonomy are complete over every code the
  canonical transport can return (`INVALID_PROVIDER_RESPONSE` is fallback
  eligible like `MALFORMED_JSON`/`SCHEMA_INVALID`; `CASE_REJECTED` is a known,
  non-fallback-eligible code — neither is lost into `UNKNOWN_ERROR`).
- `SemanticRuntimeResult` fully self-validates: every typed field is checked
  by exact type (not merely truthy-equal), and a failure's `error_type` is
  mechanically bound to what its attempts actually recorded.
- Importing `product_intelligence.semantic` pulls in no evaluation module, no
  Django, and no network client. The live transport is resolved lazily.

**The frozen semantic runtime is wired into execution** behind the semantic integration boundary for explicitly eligible candidates. The frozen runtime exists
and is tested offline; it is called from the research pipeline through `evaluate_semantic_matches` — that
wiring was FU3B, now implemented and approved.

**AI_ASSISTED_MATCH remains entirely OUTSIDE existing 4A aggregation.** It is
not "accepted but not VERIFIED" — an `AI_ASSISTED_MATCH` assessment does not
enter a price bucket at all, regardless of how valid its price is. Only
`EvidenceDecision.ACCEPTED` enters 4A aggregation. This exclusion is part of
the frozen FU3A/FU3B contract.

## Project facts (already delivered outside repo)

- FoxPro launcher: **Manually integrated outside this repository — delivered,
  not pending.** The client code is maintained in the existing Visual FoxPro
  sales-order application. The server-side GET prefill contract is implemented
  and localhost UAT passed.
- 4C-B-FU corrective: Exact structural duplicate ListingObservation
  deduplication implemented in `execution/orchestration._deduplicate_exact_observations`.

## FU3B — Semantic execution integration

**APPROVED / FROZEN**

FU3B wires the frozen FU3A semantic runtime into real research execution:

- Deterministic matching remains first authority; deterministic `ACCEPTED` bypasses semantic
- Explicit `MPN_MISMATCH` bypasses semantic
- Semantic eligible:
  - `NO_EXPLICIT_MPN_EVIDENCE + TITLE_TEXT`
  - `NO_EXPLICIT_MPN_EVIDENCE + SKU_FIELD`
  - `PARTIAL_MPN_ONLY`
- Not semantic-enabled in FU3B:
  - `NO_EXPLICIT_MPN_EVIDENCE + NONE`
  - description-only / `UNDECIDED`
- Bounded semantic failure leaves run usable
- Programming/config exceptions propagate to existing catastrophic boundary
- AI-assisted matches retained in `ExecutionResult.ai_assisted_matches`
- `ai_assisted_match_count` is derived
- `AiAssistedMatchResult` mechanically binds provenance
- `SEMANTIC` execution evidence uses bounded controlled detail codes
- Migration 0005 is choices-only metadata
- `AI_ASSISTED_MATCH` remains entirely outside 4A
- `PriceIntelligenceSnapshot` remains deterministic-only
- Human checkbox/UI selection for user-curated summary: deferred future work

## Research orchestration

Base 4C orchestration contract: **frozen**
FU3B semantic execution extension: **APPROVED / FROZEN**

Implementation snapshot:

- Research orchestration: Base 4C frozen; FU3B semantic extension frozen
- Semantic execution integration: Implemented / APPROVED / FROZEN

## Web layer architecture

The web layer may import only the public execution API:

```
web  ->  product_intelligence.execution  (execute_research_run, ExecutionError)
web  ->  product_intelligence.runs  (ClaimExecutionFailed, retry_run, ResearchRun)
```

The web layer MUST NOT import:
- `product_intelligence.execution.orchestration` (or any execution submodule)
- `product_intelligence.execution` (bare module import)
- `product_intelligence.providers` (or any provider submodule)
- `product_intelligence.runs.execution_claims` (internal)

## FoxPro ownership

FoxPro source code is NOT maintained in this repository. This repository
owns only the launcher-facing HTTP intake contract:

```
GET /research/new?mpn=<encoded>&description=<encoded>
```

The project lead maintains the FoxPro client code manually in the existing
Visual FoxPro sales-order application.

The six failures were exactly:

- `tests/evaluation/test_evaluation_boundaries.py::test_loading_the_corpus_imports_no_framework_or_provider`
- `tests/providers/test_provider_boundaries.py::test_importing_the_provider_boundary_pulls_in_no_third_party_dependency`

- `tests/runs/test_research_run_boundaries.py::test_the_domain_still_imports_without_django_present`

### Targeted final evidence

- `tests/execution/test_semantic_integration.py`: 50 passed
- `tests/execution`: 115 passed
- `tests/semantic`: 305 passed
- `tests/research/test_price_aggregation_contract.py`: 46 passed
- `tests/evaluation/semantic`: 217 passed

Note: this Windows / Python 3.14 workstation has a fixed seven-node
subprocess-boundary flake allowlist. These nodes may fail independently
between runs with OSError: [WinError 6/50] from
subprocess.run(..., capture_output=True). In the FU3B authoritative final run,
six of the seven allowed nodes failed and the remaining allowed node passed.
No node outside the fixed seven-node allowlist failed.

## Next delivery priority

**PRODUCT-INTEL.PILOT-UX — FU3B Semantic Execution Integration: APPROVED / FROZEN.**

Deferred future work:
- Human checkbox selection for user-curated summary

**PRODUCT-INTEL.5B — FoxPro Launcher**: server side implemented; the client is
already integrated outside this repository and localhost UAT passed.

## Semantic qualification harness

**APPROVED / FROZEN**

The semantic qualification corpus, prompt v1.1, evaluator mathematics,
qualification thresholds, expected decisions, and safety gates are APPROVED AND FROZEN.

- Prompt v1.1 SHA256: f50e5584659f953ce73a97ccc8bc1ff487fbeeb37e2e0a72e52210613aeab1ff
- Corpus SHA256: 3c21d6fcd4eefa5cc383792abfd9308bd5c03315834c8ffdffd0f6a2b3619ca1

Do NOT modify:
- evaluation/semantic_corpus/cases.json truth labels or case contents
- SEMANTIC_PROMPT_VERSION = "1.1"
- semantic system/user prompt semantics
- semantic evaluator formulas
- qualification gates
- production research/matching.py
- production aggregation (4A FROZEN)
- production execution authority (frozen 4C/FU3B execution semantics preserved;
  future explicitly approved phases may extend)

Since FU3A2 the frozen prompt text, decision vocabulary, response schema and
strict parser/validator physically live in
`product_intelligence/semantic/contract.py`. `evaluation/semantic/prompt.py`,
`vocabulary.py` and `evaluator.py` re-export those same objects. The freeze
applies to the behaviour wherever it lives; the extraction was proved
behaviour-preserving by the two SHA256 fingerprints above.

## Model qualification runner

**IMPLEMENTED**

Semantic qualification harness infrastructure is implemented:

* transport.py - Abstract transport interface + OpenAI-compatible HTTP
* model_catalog.py - Explicit model catalog (8 primary + 1 smoke + 3 skip)
* runner.py - Benchmark runner with durable artifacts
* cli.py - CLI for list-models, run, evaluate, compare
* comparison.py - Offline comparison utility

All tests use fake transports / recorded responses. No live network calls.

**Two models have passed the formal FULL qualification gates**:
`amax/nemotron-3-super` (primary) and `vllm-262k/Qwen3.6-27B-262K` (fallback).
They are the pinned production route.

## FU3A — Production Semantic Runtime Contract

**APPROVED / FROZEN.** (Corrective history: FU3A2B, FU3A2C, FU3A2D, FU3A2E,
FU3A2F — labels for the corrective path to this freeze, not separate durable
phases. FU3A2F was the final corrective pass; ChatGPT's independent review of
the final FU3A2F `runtime.py` and `test_runtime.py` approved the contract.)

Both `semantic/contract.py` and `EvidenceDecision.AI_ASSISTED_MATCH` are now
frozen as part of this approval.

### Single source of truth

`product_intelligence/semantic/contract.py` is the canonical implementation of:

* Prompt v1.1 (`SEMANTIC_PROMPT_VERSION`, `SYSTEM_PROMPT`,
  `USER_PROMPT_TEMPLATE`, `SemanticPrompt`, `build_prompt`)
* `SemanticDecision`, `ConfidenceLevel`, `SemanticMatchResponse`
* `parse_raw_output`, `validate_response`, `RawOutputParseError`

`evaluation/semantic/prompt.py`, `vocabulary.py` and `evaluator.py` re-export
those objects. Sharing is proved by object identity, not by an import
statement (`tests/semantic/test_contract_sharing.py`). Production does not
import `product_intelligence.evaluation.semantic.*`.

`product_intelligence/semantic/transport.py` is likewise the canonical
transport implementation (HTTP call, error classification, all three
transport classes); `evaluation/semantic/transport.py` re-exports it rather
than keeping a second copy — proved by object identity in
`tests/semantic/test_contract_sharing.py`, same as the contract.

### Import boundary

Importing `product_intelligence.semantic` loads no
`product_intelligence.evaluation.*` module, no Django, and no network client
(`requests`, `urllib`, `urllib3`, `httpx`, `aiohttp`). `evaluation.semantic.transport`
is NOT whitelisted: the live transport is imported lazily inside transport
construction. Enforced by `tests/semantic/test_runtime_boundaries.py`, which
inspects real post-import `sys.modules` state from a clean module state — and
(FU3A2D) also restores each evicted module's *parent-package attribute*, not
only its `sys.modules` entry, so a test that reimports
`product_intelligence.semantic` cannot leave `product_intelligence.semantic`
(attribute access) and `sys.modules["product_intelligence.semantic"]`
pointing at two different objects for the rest of the test session.

### Pinned qualified route

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Primary | `amax` / `nemotron-3-super` |
| Fallback | `vllm-262k` / `Qwen3.6-27B-262K` |
| temperature | `0.0` (exact float — `type(x) is float`, so `0`/`False` are rejected) |
| max_tokens | `32768` |

`SemanticRuntimeConfig` keeps these fields for compatibility, but
`validate_runtime_config` rejects any deviation before a transport is built or
called — by exact type where numeric equality alone would be insufficient
(`0`/`False` are numerically `== 0.0` but are not the qualified float). Only
`request_timeout_seconds` is configurable, and an unreadable or non-finite
environment value (`PI_SEMANTIC_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=abc`/`nan`/`inf`) fails
closed rather than silently defaulting.

### Fallback policy

Fallback uses an EXPLICIT allowlist (`PRIMARY_FALLBACK_ELIGIBLE_ERRORS`), never
"anything outside a deny set", so an unrecognised error code cannot silently
buy a second paid model call. Both lookup tables the runtime and
`SemanticRuntimeResult` index (`_PRIMARY_STATUS_TO_ERROR_TYPE`,
`_FALLBACK_STATUS_TO_ERROR_TYPE`) are complete over every non-OK status, and
every code the canonical transport's `ALL_ERROR_TYPES` can return has an
intentional mapping — proved by
`tests/semantic/test_runtime.py::TestEveryCanonicalTransportCodeHasAnIntentionalMapping`.

Eligible: `TIMEOUT`, `DNS_ERROR`, `TLS_ERROR`, `CONNECTION_ERROR`,
`RATE_LIMITED`, `HTTP_ERROR`, `PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE`, `AUTHENTICATION_FAILED`,
`MODEL_NOT_FOUND`, `EMPTY_RESPONSE`, `MALFORMED_JSON`, `SCHEMA_INVALID`,
`MODEL_IDENTITY_MISMATCH`, `INVALID_RESPONSE` (FU3A2D: a malformed HTTP-200
provider envelope is an execution/output-contract failure of the same kind as
`MALFORMED_JSON`/`SCHEMA_INVALID`, and now buys one fallback attempt the same
way they do).

Not eligible: `INVALID_REQUEST_CONFIGURATION`, `UNSUPPORTED_PARAMETER`,
`PROVIDER_NOT_CONFIGURED`, `CASE_REJECTED` (FU3A2D: a content-policy rejection
of the case's own content — retrying the identical content against a
different model would not help — kept as its own known bounded status,
distinct from `UNKNOWN_ERROR`), an invalid `SemanticRuntimeConfig`, any
genuinely unrecognised error code, and programming exceptions.

A valid primary decision (`MATCH`, `NO_MATCH`, `UNCERTAIN`) is FINAL: exactly
one primary call, zero fallback calls.

### Model identity

Exact provider-reported model identity is mandatory. A primary that reports the
wrong model, or reports no model at all, falls back exactly once. A fallback
that reports the wrong model or no model is a final semantic failure — there is
no third provider.

### Provenance and safety

`SemanticRuntimeResult` carries the requested primary route, a tuple of frozen
`SemanticAttempt` records (provider, model, bounded status, latency), the
fallback flag and reason, and the bounded final error type. On ANY final
failure `actual_provider` and `actual_model` are `None`. No raw response, no
provider body, no exception text, no API key, and no chain-of-thought is
retained. Programming exceptions propagate rather than becoming a fallback.

`SemanticRuntimeResult` is fully self-validating (FU3A2D): every typed field
(`decision`, `confidence`, `error_type`, `fallback_reason`, `fallback_used`,
and the three attribute tuples) is checked by exact type, not merely accepted
and left to fail later inside `to_dict()`. A failure's `error_type` is
mechanically bound to what its attempts actually recorded — a one-attempt
failure's `error_type` must equal `_PRIMARY_STATUS_TO_ERROR_TYPE[first.status]`,
a two-attempt failure's must equal
`_FALLBACK_STATUS_TO_ERROR_TYPE[second.status]` — so a result cannot claim,
say, `PRIMARY_MODEL_NOT_FOUND` for an attempt that actually timed out.

### Relationship to 4A

**AI_ASSISTED_MATCH is OUTSIDE existing 4A aggregation**, not merely "not
VERIFIED". Only `EvidenceDecision.ACCEPTED` enters a price bucket; an
`AI_ASSISTED_MATCH` assessment with a perfectly valid numeric price is excluded
with `IDENTITY_NOT_ACCEPTED` and cannot contribute to any bucket statistic.
`product_intelligence/research/aggregation.py` is unchanged.

## Known issues / debt

- FU3A Production Semantic Runtime Contract: APPROVED / FROZEN
- FU3B Semantic Execution Integration: APPROVED / FROZEN
- Human checkbox/UI selection for user-curated summary: deferred future work
- This Windows / Python 3.14 workstation has a fixed seven-node subprocess-boundary
  flake allowlist. In the authoritative FU3B final run, six of the seven allowed
  nodes failed and the remaining allowed node passed. No node outside the fixed
  seven-node allowlist failed. Environment limitation, not a product defect.
